The inventory management tool allows to schedule the placement, transfers and slaughter/sale of pigs based on the weaning/slaughter schedule. For Japfaâ€™s environment, the weaning accommodation schedule will present the Grower sites and not the identified piglets. For nursery/finishing/wean to finish placement, the system considers all available farms, houses and the availability of entity groups created in the system. For the plant slaughter schedule, the projected and the actual number of pigs available in the entities group are considered based on the calendar and target settings.
It is expected to see the entities age within the cards summary to support in the decision making.
