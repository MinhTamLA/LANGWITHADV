mtech-prep.txt:
I just saw that hello.
The last moment at the last dinner.
No, uh, adrial is our team lead and he actually works out of our office in Brazil, so he he didn't make it to Expo.
It is on his list to do sometime soon though.
You will not believe he had two other meetings, kind of booked at the.
Same time if.
One of them in soon.
Then he'll kind of join at the last number still here.
OK.
OK.
OK, sounds good.
Yes, so basically on the agenda I proposed.
It covers all of the topics that we typically talk to our new customers about generally speaking, and I'm very impressed.
You have a lot of teams that will participate that does.
That isn't always the case.
And then I of course added in some of the items that are very specific to you, like the hyper integration or those types of things.
If there are other topics that you've talked about to John that we're not.
On this list.
Please let me know and then we can add them or add them when we're there or whatever the case may be.
So generally speaking on on the farm visits I, I know that you wanted to start the session with that and I guess my question is what?
What do you guys hope that we will learn?
From that, going to the various farms, will it be able to see how the data flows there or just to see the farms themselves?
Obviously the sales center is something new for M tech, but I was just curious about that in case I need to formulate any questions for when we go to it.
Yeah, sure, yeah, I haven't.
Uhm, well that I think.
Depends on how all the paper work continues and I haven't really talked to John about that, so I don't have a set date at this moment from my leadership as to when we will be coming there.
So I think a lot of that resides on.
Well, how you and.
John continue with this and what he comes back to.
Well I guess technically both of our bosses, so whenever he communicates that then we will get the plans in place to work with your schedule.
So that was the kind of time frame I proposed because I understood that that would work for you, but my understanding is that the.
Uh, procurement paperwork will have to be in place in order for me to move forward, making those plans.
So I'm assuming John has been talking to you about all of the.
And and.
Once we understand where we're at with that, then we will book the tickets and talk to you about how to procure hotels or where you prefer.
We stare and those types of things.
Yes please.
I assume yes.
So when I received the initial request, it mentioned going to uh, South Farm, a finishing farm and a sales center and and I proposed back going at least to the sales center, because that is something new for M tech, but we have a lot of experience going to.
South Farms and finishing farms, at least on the team.
So that is my question.
If there are things there that you want us to see people we need to meet processes we need.
You want us to understand that you think are unique.
Then we can extend the days because someone had told me that the.
Well, obviously for bio security reasons, all of that can't happen in one day, but then, secondarily, they may be at different parts of your country.
So I'm asking you what what do you want us to do?
And that's where I'm looking for guidance, because obviously you have different bio security rules it here in the states we can't go to South farms and finishing farms, at least in any of the companies I ever worked with.
At the same time, so I I was thinking getting to all of these farms and covering all these topics could be difficult, but.
Will rely on you to tell us what farms you definitely want us to go to and how we need to restructure this for sure.
OK.
That sounds good.
And then Casey, can you help me with that?
Because you provided or someone provided the participant team names.
So at that point you can OK perfect.
Alright, so that was.
My one primary concern, how were we going to get to all of these farms wherever they may live in your country?
So that we could see everything you wanted.
Us to see.
I got that.
Sounds good.
OK, alright, so as it relates.
To the company overview, I know UM.
You have provided some documents over the course of the last several months and I think it would be good too.
Just review them.
Make sure you know you kind of have them sort of as complete as possible.
Going into the discussion, any workflows documentation, because we will really utilize that to drive the next step of the conversation, which is what we call our pre implementation.
And I'll pull up some examples of these so you can kind of see all of the questions that we will talk through because it's basically.
These documents are an end to end representation of how Jaffa will want to use emtec what.
You currently do.
How you hope to expand using M tech and then any gaps that we've already either identified, like for instance there were couple data entry points.
I know that pig champ has that Emtek doesn't.
We will touch on all of those topics.
So let's see here.
Here let me know if my screen changed so you can see a Word document.
So basically we.
Talk through them.
Text, wine, process diagram.
We get a lot of information.
If I Scroll down here about your company like things, even fiscal type things.
I mean it's.
It's basically everything that emtek would do, so they'll need a lot of different.
Teams participation I think.
Uhm, how do you invoice?
Watch your cost center structure, our products bought and sold, and I can provide this to you after this call today so you can start taking a look at some of these questions as well.
And obviously you'll want to formulate the answers, but that may tell you which people you think you want to participate.
Once we get the basics about your overall company structure, then we have to talk about the different products that you're going to manage and an emtek products are all things including animals, feed formulas, field product.
So all the inventory and non inventory, medications, vaccinations.
There are places in M tech to enter and manage all of that information, and then we also have a map.
For that, that type of thing, I'll also provide you if you haven't seen it already.
UM, information about the master data that we're going to talk about, so we have this document.
That can help you dictate where the sources of this information are in your current systems, and then make sure that we're in alignment on how this information would be entered into emtek, so that when we get there.
We could have a pretty solid plan. You know what this is going to look like for you guys. Now I know we have set-up some South farms in there using some basic information, but there's obviously a lot more things that we will need to set-up an M tech for this to work.
Come to its full capacity for you so you will receive these documents.
This particular one just talks about the very, very high level master data, and then there's some other ones that are.
Let me find that one.
To come.
Cell production, so this will get into all of your transactions and this is where I imagine we will see that you either enter additional stuff or maybe there's certain things that you don't want to enter and we can help set-up your screens so that you only see the information.
That is part in its job.
A drill.
Do you have anything you want to add there?
Here yeah.
Right?
As those screens are completed in amino, UM, the goal is for us to start transitioning some of these documents as quickly as we can, but we haven't had a lot of time here in the last few weeks to to work with amino and and get in there.
So that is part of our.
Are going forward.
Here planned so this will look slightly different, but as Adrian said, the content is the same, you're just going to have a nice new view for it.
Any questions so far?
Correct, yeah?
Specifically the word documents you don't have to fill it out or anything just so you're aware of what we'll talk about.
If you want to review the Excel documents that are more of a template for data entry.
And you know, I'll give it.
For instance, sometimes we have to figure out naming structures for farms, so there's some sort of consistent plan.
If you already have one, then that will be good to know.
So so so.
Things like that.
So when we get there, we can help move it along smoothly.
cause we do have a lot of territory to cover that would be great, but if you.
Don't have a plan for that.
That's a perfect time for us.
To talk about it while we're there.
So then the next thing we'll do is we will go into the software itself.
And walk through the screens.
If there's any questions as it relates to some of the things that you do.
So probably 1 area.
I'm sure we'll spend quite a bit of time is on our genetics module as it relates to hyper and the integration that I know that they'll be proposing.
So my understanding is they have a certain integration today.
Currently with you with Pig Champ.
But when we spoke to them, they seem to have an interest in expanding that for some additional information.
So those are the kinds of things that we can talk through.
You know, generally when we come out of it, people are assigned to go back and find out.
You know, whoever the the lead is, for that they'll come back and say what?
Is it afterwards?
You're definitely going to do.
Or who else do we need to talk to when we get to that point so that this area?
Right here?
I think we will spend quite a bit of time on would be my guess.
And then similarly.
That would be great.
Get we had a one hour call with them, UM, that they just kind of briefly talked about.
That they may want additional information, but nothing was firmly defined as to what that was and when they would be able to create an API.
Uhm, 2M tech specifically. Amino is really driven on API's to connect out to other hardware.
Air software controls all of that type of thing, so that would be something.
Maybe during that discussion we could define an overall plan to how to accomplish that together for you guys.
Uh, well we do have.
We did have another time slot for integrations or connectivity.
Type of opportunities.
But if you have other.
Within yourself arms.
So if we're going to break this out by phase of production, we could go ahead and talk about that.
While we are there, or in those specific meetings, you just just need to know what those are.
Earth, we certainly can come wherever you think it's appropriate and that's part of what we usually find out when we get there.
You're doing even more things than we ever talked about in any of these conversations.
Before we got there.
So sure, yeah.
Yes, probably one thing to know about the hyper integration is we did try to get the piglet that identified piglet list from the Pig Champ data export.
But there is a glitch with pig champ that it puts all of the piglets on all of the litters that the same piglets on every litter that the sow ever had.
Not like just the last litter or the appropriate litter.
So I did mention.
Too hyper and they mentioned during our call that they would be willing to give us an export directly from their genetic system that we can upload into M tech in in the short term.
Until everything is on M tech.
Because we do handle individually identified piglets, you know from end to end through our transactions.
But right now we can't upload it from what you currently have in pig champ because there's no way to know which litter had actually belonged to without somebody doing a lot of manual work.
That makes sense.
I think so.
There was a lot of piglets on that list.
Yeah, yeah for sure.
OK, so.
So on the South side you know will cover all of your typical production.
We will talk about your farms, your genetic nucleus, genetic multipliers, individual piglets, how your how we will transfer the data back and forth to high poor.
Uhm, how we will get from hype or the appropriate data load that we need for your individual piglets.
And then any type of scale systems if they're smart scales.
If we can find a way we we've done that with some other, UM?
Scale system, so we'll just have to take a look at the equipment that you have and formulate a plan from there.
How we can try to integrate that.
Then on the grill outside, oh, go ahead.
And we have already integrated many, many times over with MAXIMUS, so it'll mostly just be a point.
To note.
I mean, I would like to see what it is specifically that you use on there.
To make sure that there's nothing, UM.
That we haven't already touched on previously.
Uhm, potentially.
I guess I'm a little.
Uh, I'm not sure what they would.
I think so.
I think that was the direction I was calling because.
Yes, that would be yeah.
Well, definitely anything that you're wanting to connect to emtek.
We're kind of going to need a list of what that is.
If there's specific models or end or functionality that is your primary interest, obviously with controllers it would be temperature, humidity, those, various types of things, and.
And that I'm assuming is pretty standard across the maximist controllers as far as I can tell, or I have seen, I've done a little bit of work with those.
I will check and see what we have as far as documentation on that, and I can always provide that back to you as well, and that might instigate a idea or a conversation on your team as well.
And and I'll make sure to add.
Or I mean.
Yeah, at this point.
Come as far as MTX concerned through the IoT hub, you know we're able to connect to smart controllers, so anything that would have a port that Kick It Out to the Internet and be able to send information through the Internet of Things.
Those are the types of controllers that were able to connect to.
Uhm, those that are manual and I'm not even sure you know if we're talking the NAHB version.
Those at this point are not able to connect because they don't have the capability themselves.
So yeah, we would just need to take a look at everything you have and make sure we don't miss anything.
OK, so on the grow outside, if we're going to use the model, that will will visit a a finishing farm and start to have those conversations.
The documents look quite a bit alike.
We will have a formal, formal document that will talk about.
How you manage all of those?
How do your if we use this little diagram, for instance, how do you move your wean pigs into your facilities?
Do you have all of these types of facility types?
Nursery finish.
We need to finish.
Do you have a different kind that that?
You know?
Maybe we haven't done anything with before.
We'll talk about the various transactions that happen there.
Your product usages feed deliveries how you want to go about doing your movements of animals from place to place onto your sales center.
As far as.
Uhm, do you transfer them over or do they always stay at one facility?
How do you want to set-up? Where will you sell them to? We'll need a list of your vendors in a list of your processing plants so that especially like for processing.
If there is a way and I guess you do such seniors to a sales center so this this will be something we will learn.
But are we able to get back that processing information?
Your individual carcass information from the plants that your animals go to?
Because for the majority of our other customers, we've been able to build up.
Integrations I guess word for that to these packing plants, so our integration so that we can upload more like this detailed information so that you can have it for reporting and you know knowing where your animals are at in the processing.
Statistics I guess.
So there's a lot of things.
That will cover here UM.
As it relates to all of that, and in addition on both the South side and the finishing side, there is an opportunity and we actually had that on a separate day because it is complex and it does involve accounting, probably more so than production usually.
How do you?
Want to do period end.
I know you guys are interested in having a period end method for weaned pig cost specific.
But you do want to do depreciation, so we'll talk through all of those things.
How do you want to do grow or payments or settlements if you will?
So there's a ton of financial information that will need to document on your behalf to make sure that the teams that will work with that specifically.
For development, have a great starting point to ask any of their questions.
So I'll also provide you this document and then there's an additional excel one that talks about these types of transactions.
Kind of an example.
What they look like in the system and the information that is mandatory, which would be these yellow boxes that we have to have in order to complete.
Those transactions or you would need to have to complete the transactions.
So all of that will be provided as well.
Any questions there?
Uh, many feeding electronic feeding systems.
Any other types of equipment on the grow outside that we would need to be aware of to integrate too?
Uhm, so when we look at houses?
If we if we.
Look in this document.
Most kind of an overall master data document.
And if if we were to look at just a house, for instance, which is kind of what you're talking about.
Over here on.
The left you can see what the breed to wean.
Houses look like.
So they have some specific information that we can capture.
Length, width, area.
Your constructed some some metrics that way.
But in the.
Girl outside there's even more information related to that.
Because we want to be able to know what your capacity is if you overstock your pigs, what that capacity is.
And your overall usable square footage because we have that available in our inventory tool.
Whenever you are moving your inventory.
From place to place so.
That you know exactly how many head you have in each facility, as well as what you're registered.
If you do that.
In Vietnam, what's your license to having those facilities as well as?
Uhm, how much square footage and things are available for them.
So yes, there are a ton of data points you can enter.
These kind of templates show you the basics.
Uhm, you can.
I guess.
Also go into the the test database and take a look in the houses.
Or we could I think Adrian we can probably get the team too.
Pull out some of that type of stuff and we can also add that to excel.
What do you think?
OK.
Yep, yeah I know on this original form here, we basically put the mandatory or basics, but we can go ahead and.
Uh, export all of those fields so that you have it and then you can decide how much of it you want to enter basically, and then we.
Can upload it.
When the time comes.
We we've actually yes.
Yes, we've done it both ways.
It depends on the size of the the company working with.
We're working with the resources that we have available during it, but if this is something that would be helpful, kind of as a pre work.
So that they can have their questions prepared for when we're there for the pre implementation in person.
That's also fine with me.
Do they actually have to complete it when we're there?
Not necessarily.
Correct, yeah?
Yes, yes.
Yeah, we want to give you transparency to what all the possibilities are and then have you start making decisions as to what you want to do with it, how far.
You know what level of detail do you want?
To enter in.
Here and if we give you this ahead of time even before we're there, then you can start to have those discussions.
But I certainly don't expect you to have them a done, because it seems like whenever we're there, you know new questions.
Pop up which is.
Perfect, but just to give people ideas on.
What this what the?
Competency of Emtec is and how we can help you.
Maybe there's something that pay champ doesn't do.
Today I'm I'm.
I'm guessing you're going to see a.
Lot of things.
That are different.
I can say that 'cause I.
Worked for pig champ for a.
Number of years before I came to M text, so I know the two systems in the way that they are are designed.
And operator different so you know.
However, we can help you understand those changes.
We're happy to do.
Go back to the agenda.
Alright, so generally speaking then uhm.
As we changed this setup, we at this point would have talked about the Southside Genetics the garage outside, but what we haven't talked about is the sales center itself, so that would probably be the next topic.
Is my assessment or assumption, uh?
During the trip and so.
I do not have a specific.
Excuse me, master data form for that.
I do believe my understanding.
Is the sales center is similar?
To, uh, finishing structure, but each of the groups are sent there and managed independently while they're there before they go to the packing plant.
Is that correct?
Uh, we will just need to understand your sales center purpose and structure.
Uhm, so that we can create that facility type in M tech.
My understanding is it is like, uh, finishing facility potentially, but each group of pigs that are sent there from your various farms are are managed within the group.
As they're sent there before they go on to the processing plant.
Is that correct or no?
OK.
Oh, OK.
Perfect.
Yeah, so we will get into the details now we have a even more expanded or at least I do.
I may have not been on the calls that that was discussed, but detail on that and then we can look through transactionally in Mtech.
How would we accomplish that with you guys and then figure out what else.
We would need to add, so I definitely think having that discussion while we're or directly after visiting the sales center would be the best.
Any other questions or comments there?
Sure, so the inventory tool is our first step towards our automated planning tools for M tech on the poultry SAT.
Hide the poultry industry is very homogenized.
Most companies do things very similarly, so they have had automated planning and forecasting tools for a long time.
On this wine side of the world, as you guys probably already know.
People like to do things differently, so Mtech had taken a couple steps at trying to create models that would automatically accomplish.
Uhm, you know moving pigs through your float.
And to know what your inventory was, various things telling you which picks to go where, when and and it just didn't work in the same way because the producers were also different.
They all had their own rules, so I took a step back.
And based off my planning activities for a very large integrator, what we realized was the primary thing that you need to know is what is your inventory of products for each week of production and where are they located so?
We built a model, uh?
Uh, screen that allows you to see every facility that you have and each week of production in your.
Nursery finish wean to finish and then all of your weaned pig projections so that you could have come if your inventory is up to date, an actual.
Count of inventory by product for your entire system, including yourself, arms, your guilt developers and that type of thing.
So we wanted to show you that functionality and walk you through it because it also allows you to drag and drop making planned placements in the system.
Instead of creating individual transactions and the other emtek menus so it's a fast way to get your data, move your pigs from place to place and keep your inventories.
Up to date.
Also within that screen, for every entity you can see.
Your capacity, your overstock capacity, your actual inventory. How many coals? How many mortality's? How many pigs have you sent to the sales center? All of that all at one time.
And it's live and up-to-date data is entered, so that's what the.
This review would be.
I'm not sure to be honest if John Demo'd.
It to you.
At all, but it's definitely the tool that we are using to then build our automation with machine learning.
On top of to get the wing pig projections from machine learning.
Versus from our farmers and then to continue building it out.
UM, showing you when your facilities are going to be empty instead of manually showing the ones that are empty, that type of thing.
That help.
So, operationally, it is usually your team that is planning UM the movements of your animals from your South farms to your finishing side of your business, and anybody that would a need to know your overall inventories for marketing purposes.
As well as.
Whomever would be in.
Yep, so that is what that tool does.
I wasn't sure you know if it had been demo'd or not, but it's basically the tool.
That brings all of.
Your information together for M tech and let you make decisions faster.
Outside of reporting in Axis bars, inventory related that's.
That's the tool.
OK.
Yes, you can come.
You can see your southward inventories on there.
You're winning pig inventories, but I would say generally beyond that it's it's perfect for either, but they grow outside is where I think we use it for the longest period of time, those weeks that they're.
Moving between facilities or preparing to go to market for sure.
Yes, yes, correct.
Whenever one thing to note, whenever you make the movements within the tool, it also creates or generates a transportation log that could be then exported, emailed whatever the case may be onto your transport companies for further use.
So kind of tries to tie all that stuff.
Come into one sort of package, so probably would be good for various people to look at it and see how you would use it in your system.
Alright, so then the second week or part of the second week.
We probably need to talk about our mobility tools.
Uhm, and I will actually.
At the end of the day on Tuesday and I was out yesterday, we did get the second mobility solution set-up.
I'm going to run it through another test on a different device.
They ran it on a phone I have.
A ruggedized device.
Want to make sure that it's syncing properly into the data that one of my teammates setup?
But we need to take a look at those tools.
I know that they will continue to expand as amino expands.
These tools will continue to evolve towards.
What that product looks like and continue to have more options on them, but just depending upon what they have ready when we come there.
Yeah, we know it will encompass, at minimum the tools that you've already seen so we can talk through those.
See if there's anything specific we need to understand from your point of view that.
We need there.
Uhm, any gaps?
And then of course the same thing would be for reports, so we'll take a full scope.
Of the reports that you currently have, there were reports that she ran from Emtek specific reports that you're looking for and then we can figure out what do those look like.
Are those just custom to Jaffa something specific you would not want another company to see?
Uh, your your design?
So we'll go through a gap analysis on that.
Additionally, for axis.
Uhm, we have to build out.
The Bureau finished version that is on the UM.
Overall plan for M tech, but to get urine.
Uh, axis, so axis axis is our business analytics tool or by platform.
We have the the version for the South side and we've had that for a.
While but the growth finished, one will be under construction this year with some of the new companies that are.
Joining us yes.
Yes, exactly.
So be interested to get your input on that.
And then as I.
Mentioned earlier, there will have to be quite a bit of discussion about you know period in settlements.
You depending impound, which teams you can have available at which times we can.
We can accomplish it at at either point.
I'll leave that to you.
Sure, and or, I mean, if.
They you have a layout.
That works well for you.
Uhm, we can make sure that that content I mean maybe it won't be exactly the same design, but that content is included in these other things so that you can have a different way of of of getting that information.
I guess though on the question about extracting the the warehouse to the.
Data like I mean.
Maybe your plan was and and this.
This could just be I.
I wasn't aware to continue to build that out on your side.
Casey, could you kind of or Tommy kind of expand on that so we know what the goal is before we come as well.
Great thank you for clarifying 'cause I was not.
You know, fully aware of what the strategy was, so that way I can involve whoever I need to from the development side on M tech as well.
Once we kind of.
Finalize the agenda, get the dates set.
UM, if at these points that we're talking about those types of things, I I may pull in some additional resources to hear the discussion because they obviously would be the ones.
You know completing the tasks whenever the time comes, so there's any technical technical questions I'll bring in.
Yeah so period and we will walk through and I know we've done this or John has done this.
The current probably won't spend as much time on that because we really want to document exactly.
Where you want to go with the wing pig UM.
Uhm, calculation on the South side.
Uhm, the method.
Because we now have a few other customers that are interested in moving to that model as well.
So M tech is going to have to decide are we going to, and my guess is we probably will have 'cause we have customers in other parts of the world that want.
Very detailed.
Uhm, period in methods knowing their costs and gestation and lactation.
In and appreciation by Sal and various other things, but I'm finding a way to support two different methods, 2 completely different methods of period in on the South side, so I really want to get into the details with you on that to make sure when we design this one we will cover your needs as well as.
A couple other customers that want to convert to that method so there's a lot of discussion happening in M tech right now with all of our customers to make sure.
Or you know whatever we come up with, it aligns for.
Everybody has a solution so so we'll work on that and then anything else as far as like settlements.
Obviously no final decisions will have to be made, but we'll, we'll start writing down the basis of what those will look like for you because we have an entire settlement team that will then work.
With you and and this information to build those out when the time comes.
But we want to touch on as much as we possibly can while we're there, and then we can work with the team when we get back to divide up all the responsibilities.
To get all this accomplished.
At least in the integration part of the discussion.
After that, I don't know if you'll want them there when you decide what your model is actually going to, because at that point it really doesn't matter where the data lives.
You you just need to tell us how do you want it.
But where they definitely will have to come into play as this last one.
This overall essay, AP and any other.
Sorry, just one quick second.
I was supposed to go to another call here in a minute.
They will definitely need to be there for the integration.
uhm so we can talk through UM.
How how will you want that? Will certain parts of the finances live in certain parts? Live in mtech? All of it in SAP.
Those are those kinds of discussions we'll have to have at that time.
Uhm, because yours are separate.
I don't see a problem with it.
Come with past past customers.
It's been usually just one team, one accounting team, that kind of had the overall ownership of a lot of those types of decisions so.
Yeah, so I think you can certainly bring them in and they can at least hear what the strategy is even if they don't impact.
How you want to?
Do it, they will definitely be involved in in in getting it accomplished.
Yeah, and we won't.
I mean from M tech side, we don't have any interest in limiting who you have participate.
That's more.
How do you want to utilize your teams time and who makes sense from your perspective?
cause I mean, part of us coming there is that we get to know you and understand your structure.
Better, but at this point I can't honestly say I know what everybody does, so.
Please, please add who you think would make more sense for you.
Sure, I'm just going to.
Send a quick note.
OK.
Yeah, UM, we definitely can.
We've had it kind of both ways where we went through the pre implementation.
All the teams kind of consumed all the information and then they went back and kind of thought about it.
How you know whatever they needed to think about, but if you have very specific ideas on that already, I think we should talk about them while we're there in person.
So if there's any questions, it's just always easier to ask at that time, so I'll make sure to add.
Some time for that for sure.
Definitely, and we can talk through what you think you're dumb, what you think your needs will be.
We do have a structure as our team.
The meeting him.
We have separate support teams as well that will be involved to answer questions.
Obviously, during the kind of hypercar time period while we're getting you.
Up to speed.
All of those questions will come directly into the the project team.
But then when we get you more into maintenance then we would definitely use our support teams to be the first line.
Kind of defense to to get those questions answered, but from my experience thus far in the six years I've been here as far as on this fine side, we stay pretty actively engaged the entire way through so.
But yeah, we can talk through what that would look like and then where those questions would would go during those different time periods for sure.
Anybody else?
OK.
Well, I will come continue to work on this agenda.
Casey, I'm assuming you're the one that put the participants on there.
When John sent this back to me so we can kind of.
Of rearrange this based off the farms we're talking about.
I know your production team is gonna need to approve that.
Or give their input, but at least put it in that format so they have something to work with to see if that makes sense to them and we can continue to evolve that till we get it where you where.
We think we need it to cover all these topics.
How does that sound?
OK got.
OK.
And then I will come.
Send back through those forms.
We'll work on some of the kind of collection lists as it relates to the metadata that would live in like houses.
That type of thing so you guys can see that.
So we'll work on gathering up that information.
To send back to you and.
I'm going to see if I can find any documentation.
I'm certain there is on the Max Miss controllers.
What we've done just to kind of.
Have that.
War front for any of these discussions.
And also I should have a document on the inventory tool, so I'll provide that as well, just so it's kind of a visual reminder of what we talked about today.
For when we get into that discussion.
When we get there, how does that sound?
OK, Yep, sounds good.
Yeah, thank you everyone, appreciate it.
